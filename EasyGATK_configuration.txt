### Configuration file for EasyGATK ###


########################### Users must manually set-up the below infomation for using EasyGATK! ####################################
## Software paths (please use absolute path with the sofware executables) ## 
BWA_path = /bin/bwa
GATK_path = /bin/GATK/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar
samtools_path = /bin/samtools
picard_path = /bin/picard/picard-1.72.jar

## Sample and working directories (please use absolute path) ##
# If the sample directory and working directory are same, please fill the same path in both places.
sample_directory = /user/restuadi/project/sample
working_directory = /user/restuadi/project/work


## Sample information (provide the sample name and fastq file names for both read1 and read2) ##
sample_name = NA12878
read1 = NA12878_1.fq
read2 = NA12878_2.fq

# Read group,  example : '@RG\tID:C4LV1ACXX.lane8\tSM:YourSampleName\tPL:YourPlatform\tLB:LibraryName'
read_group = @RG\ID:C4LV1ACXX.lane8\SM:NA12878\PL:Illumina\LB:QBI


## Reference genome (we recommend users download the GATK bundle and then set the path below) ##
# GATK bundle path
GATK_bundle = /bin/GATK_bundle2.5/hg19/


## The path of the bed file (a standard bed file listing exome capture regions) ##
bed_file_path = /user/restuadi/project/work/UCSC_exomes_bedfile


## Do you want to use VQSR (yes/no)? By default is 'yes'. If 'no', hard filtering will be applied.
VQSR = yes

# If yes, for the successful application of VQSR, please provide the "gvcf.list" file which lists the full path of all borrowed "g.vcf" files (each line represents one borrowed gvcf file). Note the file name can be different but the file extension must be ".list". An example of the "gvcf.list" is provided in the template folder. EasyGATK users may just change the path and file name based on the template file. In "gvcf.list" users don't need to provide the full path for the current processing sample because the gvcf file of the current processing sample will be automatically added in the end of the "gvcf.list" file.
gvcf_directory = /user/restuadi/work/gvcf.list


########################### Users must manually set-up the above information for using EasyGATK! ####################################






########################### Below settings are optional, but we recommend users to check before using EasyGATK. #####################

####### Step 1 : Reads Mapping #######
# Memory available for BWA mapping (default: 5G)
mapping_memory = 5G

# Number of threads for BWA mapping (default: 8)
thread_num = 8



####### Step 2 : GATK Pre-processing (i.e. BQSR, indel realignment) #######
# Memory for GATK pre-processing (default: 20G)
bam_memory = 20G



####### Step 3 : Estimation of sequencing depth and set-up of the minPruning value ########
# Do you want EasyGATK estimate the sequencign depth and automaticaly set-up the minPruning value for HaplotypeCaller? (yes/no, by default is "yes") 
minprune_estimate = no

# If the above answer is "no", then users need to define the minPruning value below. By default EasyGATK will use a minPruning value of 3.
minpruning = 3



####### Step 4 : Variant Calling using HaplotypeCaller ########
# Memory for HaplotypeCaller, hard filtering and VQSR (the default value of 20G memory will work in most cases). Note that small minPrune value or data with high sequencing depth (e.g. >100X) may require more memory in this step.
call_memory = 20G


####### We are currently working to separate the HaplotypeCaller and VQSR/hard filtering functions so that users can easily use EasyGATK to process borrowed WES samples as well (Step 4: HaplotypeCaller & Step 5: VQSR/hard filtering). The new version will be released soon. #######
